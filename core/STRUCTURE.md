## 🛑 Maintenance Mandates
1. **Documentation Parity**: If a file is created, it MUST be added to this map.
2. **System Integrity**: No file should exist outside of a defined System Level (1-5) or Infra layer.
3. **Periodic Pruning**: Review this map weekly to remove "Ghost Files" (deprecated logic).
