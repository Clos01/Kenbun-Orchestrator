The Orchestrator — Meta-tool that chains all Pro Stack tools into intelligent workflows.

Instead of manually calling 7 tools in sequence, the AI calls ONE tool:
    orchestrate("bug_fix", task="Fix the auth bypass", file_path="src/login.py")

The orchestrator runs the full pipeline and returns a structured report.

Architecture: State-machine engine with 3 built-in pipelines.
Designed in collaboration with Gemini 2.0 Flash.

    Diagnose a bug and propose a concrete patch.

    This closes the long-standing gap where the `bug_fix` pipeline would
    silently exit as "Unresolved" whenever no past memory hit existed and
    no file_path/code_snippet was supplied: every conditional step was
    skipped and no LLM ever inspected the bug.

    Strategy:
      1. If file_path exists and is small enough, read it for ground truth.
      2. Compose a tight diagnostic prompt (error/log + optional code).
      3. Call the gateway LLM (LM Studio → Ollama → cloud fallback).
      4. Return the analyzer's verdict as a string the pipeline can persist.

    The trailing **_unused_kwargs sink absorbs spurious kwargs (e.g. ``tech_key``)
    that older or hot-reloaded pipeline definitions may still pass. Without it,
    the orchestrator step crashes with ``TypeError: _analyze_bug() got an
    unexpected keyword argument ...`` whenever ``skip_if`` does not mask the step.
