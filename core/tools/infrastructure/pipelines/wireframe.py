"""Wireframe pipeline: spec -> graph -> validate -> critique -> repair -> push.

Why this exists as a pipeline rather than a single tool call:

The generator is a HYBRID by design. An LLM decides the semantic structure and
the layout INTENT (regions, rows, spans, table columns); code turns that into a
graph of what connects to what. Asking a model to emit x/y/width/height for a
couple of hundred elements produces overlapping boxes — spatial arithmetic is the
one part of this it is worst at.

Note that the emitter no longer produces coordinates either. It used to, and that
was the source of the overlapping cards on the board: hand-rolled 2D packing with
no collision test drifts back into overlap however carefully the constants are
tuned. Geometry now belongs to the renderer, which has measured sizes to work
from. See tools/craft/wireframe_graph.py for the full account.

What the model IS good at is judging whether the resulting diagram actually
represents the thing that was asked for. So the accuracy loop is:

  1. spec      — LLM designs structure + layout intent
  2. graph     — code emits nodes + typed edges, no coordinates
  3. validate  — code checks the document is structurally well-formed
  4. audit     — code checks nothing is stranded, unwired or unrenderable
  5. critique  — LLM compares the resulting structure back to the request
  6. repair    — feed the critique back into a new spec, re-emit, re-check

Steps 3 and 4 are deterministic on purpose: they are facts, not judgements, and
there is no sense paying a model to notice a duplicate node id.
