"""
🛡️ safe_exec — Strict argv-allowlisted subprocess helper.

PURPOSE
-------
Centralized replacement for every ``subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True)`` site in
the Kenbun codebase. ``shell=True`` with a caller-supplied string is a
Remote-Code-Execution primitive: a single shell metacharacter (``;``, ``&&``,
backtick, ``$()``, redirection) can pivot a benign-looking command into
arbitrary host execution. This module replaces that pattern with:

1. ``shlex.split`` of the command string into an argv list (no shell).
2. A strict allowlist check on ``argv[0]`` (basename only).
3. A metacharacter pre-scan as defense-in-depth — even if shlex tolerates
   some patterns, anything resembling shell composition is refused.
4. ``subprocess.run(argv, shell=False, ...)``.

This is intentionally narrower than ``is_yolo_safe`` in ``terminal_chat.py``:
that function inspects substrings of a *shell* string, which is fragile. This
helper refuses to ever hand the string to a shell in the first place.

USAGE
-----
    from tools.utils.safe_exec import safe_run, UnsafeCommandError

    try:
        result = safe_run("git status --short", cwd="/app", timeout=30.0)
    except UnsafeCommandError as e:
        return f"❌ Security Violation: {e}"
    # result is a subprocess.CompletedProcess

ADDING NEW BINARIES
-------------------
Extending ``ALLOWED_BINARIES`` is a deliberate security decision. New entries
should be reviewed by System 2 (Supervisor) and accompanied by a unit test in
``core/tests/test_safe_exec.py``.
