"""Materialize the actual code under review for the code_review / bug_fix pipelines.

Historically the code_review pipeline fed its reviewers (Gemini + the System 2
supervisor) only a *repo map* — file paths and bare function/class signatures —
whenever the caller passed just a ``project_path``. The adversarial court then
correctly complained it had "no implementation to judge" and rubber-stamped
APPROVED on zero evidence.

``load_review_target`` closes that gap: given whatever the caller supplied, it
returns a string of real source (or a real diff) for the reviewers to read.

Resolution order (first non-empty wins):
    1. an explicit ``code_snippet`` (caller already gave us the code)
    2. explicit ``file_path`` — one path or a comma/newline-separated list
    3. file paths mentioned in the ``task`` text that exist in the repo
    4. the working-tree diff against HEAD (``git diff HEAD``)

All file reads are confined to ``project_path`` so a crafted task string can't
make the reviewer slurp arbitrary files off disk.
