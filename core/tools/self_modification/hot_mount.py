"""DSH-05 slice 1 -- mount a tool into the running swarm, revert it on guard failure.

    from tools.self_modification import guarded_mount

    def my_new_tool(x: int) -> str:
        "adds one"
        return str(x + 1)

    res = guarded_mount(my_new_tool, name="add_one",
                        guard=lambda fn: fn(1) == "2")
    if res.guard_passed:
        ...            # tool is live in the registry AND the FastMCP surface
    # if the guard failed, res.reverted is True and the registry is untouched

No process restart either way. This is the loop `agent_self_improve` needs: try a
candidate tool against a smoke check, keep it if it works, drop it if it does not.

**Trust boundary.** `hot_mount_tool` takes an *already-defined Python callable*,
not source text -- it does not `exec` anything. To go from generated *source* to
a callable, use `guarded_mount_source` (DSH-05 s2): it runs
`compile_source.compile_tool_source` first -- an AST allowlist + a restricted
`exec` -- then hands the callable to `guarded_mount`. That is defence in depth,
not a hardened sandbox: the source must still come from Kenbun's own generation
pipeline, never from a tool argument or routed model/user input.

**Known limitation.** `bayesian._known_tool_ids()` is cached from the last
harvest, so a hot-mounted tool is invisible to routing telemetry until a fresh
harvest runs -- `tune_swarm` logs "rejecting unknown tool_id" and skips the write
(by design: keeps probe/self-mod tools out of the real Bayesian store). Wiring a
cache-refresh hook into `hot_mount_tool` is a later slice.
