"""
UI-TARS functional test for Client App. Runs ON Edge_Node (needs DISPLAY=:0).

Each UI-TARS look costs ~40s and is prompt/vision-bound, not generation-bound
(measured: 183 prompt tok -> 7.1s, 959 prompt tok -> 41.8s, output length
barely moves it). So the polling loop is pure local pixel math, and the model
is called exactly once per page -- for the verdict a human would give.

Asserts two things per page:
  1. time-to-content  -- deterministic, from dark-pixel ratio in the content area
  2. DATA vs SKELETON -- UI-TARS, forced to a one-word answer

The second exists because the earlier at-rest audit had UI-TARS confidently
describe skeleton bars as "a list of items with checkboxes". A closed question
it can actually answer is worth more than a paragraph it invents.
