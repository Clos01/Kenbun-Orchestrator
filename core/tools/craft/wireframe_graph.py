"""AI wireframe generator — graph emitter.

prompt -> LLM structured spec -> a LAYOUT-FREE graph document -> board.

Why there are no coordinates in here
------------------------------------
The previous emitter (spec_to_excalidraw) computed every x/y itself and shipped a
finished Excalidraw scene. That is where the diagram's messiness came from, and it
was structural rather than a bug you could chase:

  * Backend cards were positioned by "centre me under the button that calls me",
    with the stacking cursor keyed on the resulting exact x. Two buttons 10px apart
    produced two different keys, so their 320px-wide endpoint cards started at the
    same y and overlapped by 310px.
  * An endpoint no button calls fell back to x = fz_x + 40, which after centring
    became x = -70 — 120px OUTSIDE the left edge of the backend band it was
    supposed to sit in. Every un-flowed GET piled up out there.
  * Entities and integrations shared one stacking dict keyed by x, but were
    different widths, so they never collided in the dict and always collided on
    the canvas.
  * Component heights were hand-summed in Python, so every new component type was
    a fresh chance for content to escape its frame.

None of that is fixable by nudging constants: hand-rolled 2D packing with no
collision test will always drift back into overlap. So the split moved. Python now
emits only WHAT is connected to WHAT; the dashboard runs dagre (a real layered
graph layout, with collision as an invariant rather than an aspiration) for the
graph, and CSS flexbox for the inside of each screen mock. Neither can overlap by
construction, which is the whole point.

The LLM-facing spec schema is UNCHANGED — see WIREFRAME_SYSTEM_PROMPT in this
module. Only the render target moved.

    A named rung goes straight at its endpoint. It deliberately does NOT go through

    from somewhere else entirely: with the Anthropic key 401ing, a request for
    claude-sonnet-5 came back 200 OK — served by gemini-flash-lite via the router's
    last-ditch native-SDK fallback, which hardcodes model_override=None and lets
    the cost bandit choose. Nothing in the reply says so. That made escalation
    impossible to express: rung 1 "succeeded", so the ladder never advanced, and
    every wireframe was drafted by the cheapest arm no matter what was configured.
    Calling the endpoint directly means a dead rung raises, and raising is what
    lets the next rung actually get its turn.

    The final rung passes url=model=None and DOES use the gateway, on purpose —
    that is the general-purpose safety net for hosts configured differently to
    this one, and by then there is nothing left to escalate to.
