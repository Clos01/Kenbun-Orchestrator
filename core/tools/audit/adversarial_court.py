System 2a: Adversarial LLM Auditing Court.

2. The Prosecuting Auditor: Acts as a red-team critic finding security traversal/injection risks.
3. The Presiding Judge: Weighs both cases and issues a final binding APPROVED/REJECTED verdict.

        must prove a flaw; here the appellant must prove the finding wrong. A
