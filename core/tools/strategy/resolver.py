"""DSH-06 slice 1 -- health-aware provider resolution.

    docs/composability-primer.md: a capability with exactly one provider is the
    same bug as static composition -- a single fixed choice in a load-bearing
    spot. When it fails you are just down.

`Resolver` is the reusable "try providers in order, demote a failed one, recover
it after a cooldown" primitive. The shell / subagent seams do a hand-rolled
version of this; DSH-06 factors it out and points every single-provider
capability (Queen decomposition, the supervisor, memory, ...) at it.
