"""Pipeline ↔ tool kwarg contract tests.

Catches the class of ghost bug where a pipeline step's ``input`` lambda
passes a kwarg the bound tool does not accept (the orchestrator only sees
the failure at runtime, and only when ``skip_if`` doesn't mask the step).

The canonical example is the one this test was written for: the
``analyze_review_request`` step in ``code_review.py`` passed ``tech_key`` to
``_analyze_bug``, which did not accept it. The orchestrator's pipeline
runner calls ``step["tool"](**input_fn(state))``, so any kwarg mismatch
becomes a ``TypeError`` at step-execution time.

This test walks every registered pipeline, evaluates each step's input
lambda against a synthetic state with every reasonable key populated, and
asserts ``input_kwargs ⊆ signature.parameters`` (or the receiver accepts
``**kwargs``).
